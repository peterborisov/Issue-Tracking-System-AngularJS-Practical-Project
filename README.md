# Issue Tracking System – AngularJS Practical Project

Design and implement an issue tracker system. The system holds projects, which have issues. 
Each project has a leader, name, description, a project key, a set of priorities which the project’s issues can use and some labels.
Each Issue has a title, description, issue key, an assignee, a status which must follow a specific status transition, a due date, a priority, some labels and user-made comments.
